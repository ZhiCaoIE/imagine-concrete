# imagine-concrete

The IMAGINE Concrete model is available for public use in two versions. A simplified web-based version of IMAGINE Concrete is available at the following URL: https://imagine-concrete.herokuapp.com/. The web-based version enables deployment of each major lever category considered in this report, subject to predefined numerical assumptions and limits aligned with our scenarios. It is meant for simple “what if” explorations of how different combinations of levers can lead to future emissions reductions in our considered end-use sectors (buildings and roadways) in China, the United States, and India.

For advanced modelers, the full Python modeling code for IMAGINE Concrete is available for download at the following URL: https://github.com/ZhiCaoIE/imagine-concrete. The Python version gives the user full control over all variables in the model, enabling generation of fully-customizable scenarios.
